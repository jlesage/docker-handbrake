This is a Docker container for HandBrake.

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on client side) or via any VNC client.

A fully automated mode is also available: drop files into a watch folder and let HandBrake process them without any user interaction.

## Quick Start

**NOTE**: The Docker command provided in this quick start is given as an example
and parameters should be adjusted to your need.

Launch the HandBrake docker container with the following command:
```
docker run -d \
    --name=handbrake \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/handbrake:/config:rw \
    -v $HOME:/storage:ro \
    -v $HOME/HandBrake/watch:/watch:rw \
    -v $HOME/HandBrake/output:/output:rw \
    jlesage/handbrake
```

Where:
  - `/docker/appdata/handbrake`: This is where the application stores its configuration, log and any files needing persistency.
  - `$HOME`: This location contains files from your host that need to be accessible by the application.
  - `$HOME/HandBrake/watch`: This is where videos to be automatically converted are located.
  - `$HOME/HandBrake/output`: This is where automatically converted video files are written.

Browse to `http://your-host-ip:5800` to access the HandBrake GUI.
Files from the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.

## Usage

```
docker run [-d] \
    --name=handbrake \
    [-e <VARIABLE_NAME>=<VALUE>]... \
    [-v <HOST_DIR>:<CONTAINER_DIR>[:PERMISSIONS]]... \
    [-p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT>]... \
    jlesage/handbrake
```
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| -d        | Run the container in background.  If not set, the container runs in foreground. |
| -e        | Pass an environment variable to the container.  See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for more details. |
| -v        | Set a volume mapping (allows to share a folder/file between the host and the container).  See the [Data Volumes](#data-volumes) section for more details. |
| -p        | Set a network port mapping (exposes an internal container port to the host).  See the [Ports](#ports) section for more details. |

### Environment Variables

To customize some properties of the container, the following environment
variables can be passed via the `-e` parameter (one for each variable).  Value
of this parameter has the format `<VARIABLE_NAME>=<VALUE>`.

| Variable       | Description                                  | Default |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|
|`USER_ID`| ID of the user the application runs as.  See [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) to better understand when this should be set. | `1000` |
|`GROUP_ID`| ID of the group the application runs as.  See [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) to better understand when this should be set. | `1000` |
|`SUP_GROUP_IDS`| Comma-separated list of supplementary group IDs of the application. | (unset) |
|`UMASK`| Mask that controls how file permissions are set for newly created files. The value of the mask is in octal notation.  By default, this variable is not set and the default umask of `022` is used, meaning that newly created files are readable by everyone, but only writable by the owner. See the following online umask calculator: http://wintelguy.com/umask-calc.pl | (unset) |
|`TZ`| [TimeZone] of the container.  Timezone can also be set by mapping `/etc/localtime` between the host and the container. | `Etc/UTC` |
|`KEEP_APP_RUNNING`| When set to `1`, the application will be automatically restarted if it crashes or if user quits it. | `0` |
|`APP_NICENESS`| Priority at which the application should run.  A niceness value of -20 is the highest priority and 19 is the lowest priority.  By default, niceness is not set, meaning that the default niceness of 0 is used.  **NOTE**: A negative niceness (priority increase) requires additional permissions.  In this case, the container should be run with the docker option `--cap-add=SYS_NICE`. | (unset) |
|`CLEAN_TMP_DIR`| When set to `1`, all files in the `/tmp` directory are delete during the container startup. | `1` |
|`DISPLAY_WIDTH`| Width (in pixels) of the application's window. | `1280` |
|`DISPLAY_HEIGHT`| Height (in pixels) of the application's window. | `768` |
|`SECURE_CONNECTION`| When set to `1`, an encrypted connection is used to access the application's GUI (either via web browser or VNC client).  See the [Security](#security) section for more details. | `0` |
|`VNC_PASSWORD`| Password needed to connect to the application's GUI.  See the [VNC Password](#vnc-password) section for more details. | (unset) |
|`X11VNC_EXTRA_OPTS`| Extra options to pass to the x11vnc server running in the Docker container.  **WARNING**: For advanced users. Do not use unless you know what you are doing. | (unset) |
|`ENABLE_CJK_FONT`| When set to `1`, open source computer font `WenQuanYi Zen Hei` is installed.  This font contains a large range of Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters. | `0` |
|`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_PRESET`| HandBrake preset used by the automatic video converter.  See the [Automatic Video Conversion](#automatic-video-conversion) section for more details. | `Very Fast 1080p30` |
|`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_FORMAT`| Video container format used by the automatic video converter for output files.  This is typically the video filename extension.  See the [Automatic Video Conversion](#automatic-video-conversion) section for more details. | `mp4` |
|`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_KEEP_SOURCE`| When set to `0`, a video that has been successfully converted is removed from the watch folder. | `1` |
|`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_SUBDIR`| Subdirectory of the output folder into which converted videos should be written.  By default, this variable is not set, meaning that videos are saved directly into `/output/`.  If `Home/Movies` is set, converted videos will be written to `/output/Home/Movies`.  Use the special value `SAME_AS_SRC` to use the same subfolder as the source.  For example, if the video source file is `/watch/Movies/mymovie.mkv`, the converted video will be written to `/output/Movies/`. | (unset) |
|`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_SOURCE_STABLE_TIME`| Time during which properties (e.g. size, time, etc) of a video file in the watch folder need to remain the same.  This is to avoid processing a file that is being copied. | `5` |
|`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_SOURCE_MIN_DURATION`| Minimum title duration (in seconds).  Shorter titles will be ignored.  This applies only to video disc sources (ISO file, `VIDEO_TS` folder or `BDMV` folder). | `10` |
|`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_CHECK_INTERVAL`| Interval (in seconds) at which the automatic video converter checks for new files. | `5` |
|`HANDBRAKE_DEBUG`| Setting this to `1` enables HandBrake debug logging for both the GUI and the automatic video converter.  For the latter, the increased verbosity is reflected in `/config/log/hb/conversion.log` (container path).  For the GUI, log messages are sent to `/config/log/hb/handbrake.debug.log` (container path).  **NOTE**: When enabled, a lot of information is generated and the log file will grow quickly.  Make sure to enable this temporarily and only when needed. | (unset) |

### Data Volumes

The following table describes data volumes used by the container.  The mappings
are set via the `-v` parameter.  Each mapping is specified with the following
format: `<HOST_DIR>:<CONTAINER_DIR>[:PERMISSIONS]`.

| Container path  | Permissions | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
|`/config`| rw | This is where the application stores its configuration, log and any files needing persistency. |
|`/storage`| ro | This location contains files from your host that need to be accessible by the application. |
|`/watch`| rw | This is where videos to be automatically converted are located. |
|`/output`| rw | This is where automatically converted video files are written. |

### Ports

Here is the list of ports used by the container.  They can be mapped to the host
via the `-p` parameter (one per port mapping).  Each mapping is defined in the
following format: `<HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT>`.  The port number inside the
container cannot be changed, but you are free to use any port on the host side.

| Port | Mapping to host | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| 5800 | Mandatory | Port used to access the application's GUI via the web interface. |
| 5900 | Optional | Port used to access the application's GUI via the VNC protocol.  Optional if no VNC client is used. |

### Changing Parameters of a Running Container

As seen, environment variables, volume mappings and port mappings are specified
while creating the container.

The following steps describe the method used to add, remove or update
parameter(s) of an existing container.  The generic idea is to destroy and
re-create the container:

  1. Stop the container (if it is running):
```
docker stop handbrake
```
  2. Remove the container:
```
docker rm handbrake
```
  3. Create/start the container using the `docker run` command, by adjusting
     parameters as needed.

**NOTE**: Since all application's data is saved under the `/config` container
folder, destroying and re-creating a container is not a problem: nothing is lost
and the application comes back with the same state (as long as the mapping of
the `/config` folder remains the same).

## Docker Compose File

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used with
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/).

Make sure to adjust according to your needs.  Note that only mandatory network
ports are part of the example.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  handbrake:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5800:5800"
    volumes:
      - "/docker/appdata/handbrake:/config:rw"
      - "$HOME:/storage:ro"
      - "$HOME/HandBrake/watch:/watch:rw"
      - "$HOME/HandBrake/output:/output:rw"
```

## Docker Image Update

If the system on which the container runs doesn't provide a way to easily update
the Docker image, the following steps can be followed:

  1. Fetch the latest image:
```
docker pull jlesage/handbrake
```
  2. Stop the container:
```
docker stop handbrake
```
  3. Remove the container:
```
docker rm handbrake
```
  4. Start the container using the `docker run` command.

### Synology

For owners of a Synology NAS, the following steps can be use to update a
container image.

  1.  Open the *Docker* application.
  2.  Click on *Registry* in the left pane.
  3.  In the search bar, type the name of the container (`jlesage/docker-handbrake`).
  4.  Select the image, click *Download* and then choose the `latest` tag.
  5.  Wait for the download to complete.  A  notification will appear once done.
  6.  Click on *Container* in the left pane.
  7.  Select your HandBrake container.
  8.  Stop it by clicking *Action*->*Stop*.
  9.  Clear the container by clicking *Action*->*Clear*.  This removes the
      container while keeping its configuration.
  10. Start the container again by clicking *Action*->*Start*. **NOTE**:  The
      container may temporarily disappear from the list while it is re-created.

### unRAID

For unRAID, a container image can be updated by following these steps:

  1. Select the *Docker* tab.
  2. Click the *Check for Updates* button at the bottom of the page.
  3. Click the *update ready* link of the container to be updated.

## User/Group IDs

When using data volumes (`-v` flags), permissions issues can occur between the
host and the container.  For example, the user within the container may not
exists on the host.  This could prevent the host from properly accessing files
and folders on the shared volume.

To avoid any problem, you can specify the user the application should run as.

This is done by passing the user ID and group ID to the container via the
`USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` environment variables.

To find the right IDs to use, issue the following command on the host, with the
user owning the data volume on the host:

    id <username>

Which gives an output like this one:
```
uid=1000(myuser) gid=1000(myuser) groups=1000(myuser),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin)
```

The value of `uid` (user ID) and `gid` (group ID) are the ones that you should
be given the container.

## Accessing the GUI

Assuming that container's ports are mapped to the same host's ports, the
graphical interface of the application can be accessed via:

  * A web browser:
```
http://<HOST IP ADDR>:5800
```

  * Any VNC client:
```
<HOST IP ADDR>:5900
```

## Security

By default, access to the application's GUI is done over an unencrypted
connection (HTTP or VNC).

Secure connection can be enabled via the `SECURE_CONNECTION` environment
variable.  See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for
more details on how to set an environment variable.

When enabled, application's GUI is performed over an HTTPs connection when
accessed with a browser.  All HTTP accesses are automatically redirected to
HTTPs.

When using a VNC client, the VNC connection is performed over SSL.  Note that
few VNC clients support this method.  [SSVNC] is one of them.

[SSVNC]: http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/ssvnc.html

### Certificates

Here are the certificate files needed by the container.  By default, when they
are missing, self-signed certificates are generated and used.  All files have
PEM encoded, x509 certificates.

| Container Path                  | Purpose                    | Content |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|
|`/config/certs/vnc-server.pem`   |VNC connection encryption.  |VNC server's private key and certificate, bundled with any root and intermediate certificates.|
|`/config/certs/web-privkey.pem`  |HTTPs connection encryption.|Web server's private key.|
|`/config/certs/web-fullchain.pem`|HTTPs connection encryption.|Web server's certificate, bundled with any root and intermediate certificates.|

**NOTE**: To prevent any certificate validity warnings/errors from the browser
or VNC client, make sure to supply your own valid certificates.

**NOTE**: Certificate files are monitored and relevant daemons are automatically
restarted when changes are detected.

### VNC Password

To restrict access to your application, a password can be specified.  This can
be done via two methods:
  * By using the `VNC_PASSWORD` environment variable.
  * By creating a `.vncpass_clear` file at the root of the `/config` volume.
    This file should contains the password in clear-text.  During the container
    startup, content of the file is obfuscated and moved to `.vncpass`.

The level of security provided by the VNC password depends on two things:
  * The type of communication channel (encrypted/unencrypted).
  * How secure access to the host is.

When using a VNC password, it is highly desirable to enable the secure
connection to prevent sending the password in clear over an unencrypted channel.

**ATTENTION**: Password is limited to 8 characters.  This limitation comes from
the Remote Framebuffer Protocol [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143) (see
section [7.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143#section-7.2.2)).  Any
characters beyhond the limit are ignored.

## Shell Access

To get shell access to a the running container, execute the following command:

```
docker exec -ti CONTAINER sh
```

Where `CONTAINER` is the ID or the name of the container used during its
creation (e.g. `crashplan-pro`).

## Reverse Proxy

The following sections contains NGINX configuration that need to be added in
order to reverse proxy to this container.

A reverse proxy server can route HTTP requests based on the hostname or the URL
path.

### Routing Based on Hostname

In this scenario, each hostname is routed to a different application/container.

For example, let's say the reverse proxy server is running on the same machine
as this container.  The server would proxy all HTTP requests sent to
`handbrake.domain.tld` to the container at `127.0.0.1:5800`.

Here are the relevant configuration elements that would be added to the NGINX
configuration:

```
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
	default upgrade;
	''      close;
}

upstream docker-handbrake {
	# If the reverse proxy server is not running on the same machine as the
	# Docker container, use the IP of the Docker host here.
	# Make sure to adjust the port according to how port 5800 of the
	# container has been mapped on the host.
	server 127.0.0.1:5800;
}

server {
	[...]

	server_name handbrake.domain.tld;

	location / {
	        proxy_pass http://docker-handbrake;
	}

	location /websockify {
		proxy_pass http://docker-handbrake;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
		proxy_read_timeout 86400;
	}
}

```

### Routing Based on URL Path

In this scenario, the hostname is the same, but different URL paths are used to
route to different applications/containers.

For example, let's say the reverse proxy server is running on the same machine
as this container.  The server would proxy all HTTP requests for
`server.domain.tld/handbrake` to the container at `127.0.0.1:5800`.

Here are the relevant configuration elements that would be added to the NGINX
configuration:

```
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
	default upgrade;
	''      close;
}

upstream docker-handbrake {
	# If the reverse proxy server is not running on the same machine as the
	# Docker container, use the IP of the Docker host here.
	# Make sure to adjust the port according to how port 5800 of the
	# container has been mapped on the host.
	server 127.0.0.1:5800;
}

server {
	[...]

	location = /handbrake {return 301 $scheme://$http_host/handbrake/;}
	location /handbrake/ {
		proxy_pass http://docker-handbrake/;
		location /handbrake/websockify {
			proxy_pass http://docker-handbrake/websockify/;
			proxy_http_version 1.1;
			proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
			proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
			proxy_read_timeout 86400;
		}
	}
}

```

## Access to Optical Drive(s)

By default, a Docker container doesn't have access to host's devices.  However,
access to one or more device can be granted with the `--device DEV` parameter.

Optical drives usually have `/dev/srX` as device.  For example, the first drive
is `/dev/sr0`, the second `/dev/sr1`, and so on.  To allow HandBrake to access
the first drive, this parameter is needed:
```
--device /dev/sr0
```

To easily find devices of optical drives, start the container and look at its
log for messages similar to these ones:
```
...
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: executing...
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: looking for usable optical drives...
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: found optical drive /dev/sr0, but it is not usable because is not exposed to the container.
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: no usable optical drive found.
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: exited 0.
...
```

Since HandBrake can decrypt DVD video discs, their conversion can be performed
directly from the optical device.  From the graphical interface, click the
`Open Source` button and browse through the file system to find your optical
drive device (e.g. `/dev/sr0`).

## Automatic Video Conversion

This container has an automatic video converter built-in.  This is useful to
batch-convert videos without user interaction.

Basically, files copied to the `/watch` container folder are automatically
converted by HandBrake to a pre-defined video format according to a pre-defined
preset.  Both the format and the preset are specified via environment variables:

| Variable       | Default |
|----------------|---------|
|`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_PRESET` | "Very Fast 1080p30" |
|`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_FORMAT` | "mp4" |

See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details
about setting environment variables.

**NOTE**: Converted videos are stored to the `/output` folder of the container.

**NOTE**: All default presets, along with personalized/custom ones, can be seen
with the HandBrake GUI.

**NOTE**: The status and progression of conversions performed by the automatic
video converter can only be seen in the container's log.  It is not something
visible from the GUI.  Container's log can be obtained by executing the command
`docker logs handbrake`, where `handbrake` is the name of the container.  Also,
full details about the conversion are stored in `/config/log/hb/conversion.log`
(container path).

### Multiple Watch Folders

If needed, up to 4 additionnal watch folders can be used:
  - `/watch2`
  - `/watch3`
  - `/watch4`
  - `/watch5`

This is useful in scenarios where videos need to be converted by different
presets.  For example, one could use a watch folder for movies and another watch
folder for TV shows, both having different encoding quality requirements.

By default, additional watch folders inherits the same settings has the main one
(`/watch`).  A setting for a particular watch folder can be overrided by adding
its index to the corresponding environment variable name.

For example, to set the HandBrake preset used to convert videos in `/watch2`,
the environment variable `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_PRESET_2` is used.
`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_PRESET_3` is used for `/watch3`, and so on.

All settings related to the automatic video converter can be overrided for each
additional watch folder:
  - `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_PRESET`
  - `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_FORMAT`
  - `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_SOURCE_STABLE_TIME`
  - `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_SOURCE_MIN_DURATION`
  - `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_SUBDIR`
  - `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_KEEP_SOURCE`

### Video Discs

The automatic video converter supports video discs, in the folllowing format:
  - ISO image file.
  - `VIDEO_TS` folder (DVD disc).
  - `BDMV` folder (Blu-ray disc).

Note that folder names are case sensitive.  For example, `video_ts`, `Video_Ts`
or `Bdmv` won't be treated as discs, but as normal directories.

Video discs can have multiple titles (the main movie, previews, extras, etc).
In a such case, each title is converted to its own file.  These files have the
suffix `.title-XX`, where `XX` is the title number. For example, if the file
`MyMovie.iso` has 2 titles, the following files would be generated:
  - `MyMovie.title-1.mp4`
  - `MyMovie.title-2.mp4`

It is possible to ignore titles shorted than a specific amount of time.  By
default, only titles longer than 10 seconds are processed.  This duration can be
adjusted via the `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_SOURCE_MIN_DURATION` environment
variable.  See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for
details about setting environment variables.

When the source is a disc folder, the name of the converted video file will
match its parent folder's name, if any.  For example:

| Watch folder path       | Converted video filename |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| /watch/VIDEO_TS         | VIDEO_TS.mp4             |
| /watch/MyMovie/VIDEO_TS | MyMovie.mp4              |

### Hooks

Custom actions can be performed using hooks.  Hooks are shell scripts executed
by the automatic video converter.

**NOTE**: Hooks are always invoked via `/bin/sh`, ignoring any shebang the
script may have.

Hooks are optional and by default, no one is defined.  A hook is defined and
executed when the script is found at a specific location.

The following table describe available hooks:

| Container location | Description | Parameter(s) |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------|
| `/config/hooks/pre_conversion.sh` | Hook executed before the beginning of a video conversion. | The first argument is the path of the converted video.  The second argument is the path to the source file.  Finally, the third argument is the name of the Handbrake preset that will be used to convert the video. |
| `/config/hooks/post_conversion.sh` | Hook executed when the conversion of a video file is terminated. | The first parameter is the status of the conversion.  A value of `0` indicates that the conversion terminated successfuly.  Any other value represent a failure.  The second argument is the path to the converted video (the output).  The third argument is the path to the source file.  Finally, the fourth argument is the name of the Handbrake preset used to convert the video. |

During the first start of the container, example hooks are installed in
`/config/hooks/`.  Example scripts have the suffix `.example`.  For example,
you can use `/config/hooks/post_conversion.sh.example` as a starting point.

**NOTE**: Keep in mind that this container has the minimal set of packages
required to run HandBrake.  This may limit actions that can be performed in
hooks.

### Temporary Conversion Directory

A video being converted is written in a hidden, temporary directory under the
root of the output directory (`/output`).  Once a conversion successfully
terminates, the video file is moved to its final location.

This feature can be useful for scenarios where the output folder is monitored
by another application: with proper configuration, one can make sure this
application only "sees" the final, converted video file and not the transient
versions.

If the monitoring application ignores hidden directories, then nothing special
is required and the application should always see the final file.

However, if the monitoring application handles hidden directories, the automatic
video converter should be configured with the
`AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_SUBDIR` environment variable sets to a
subdirectory.  The application can then be configured to monitor this
subdirectory.  For example, if `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_SUBDIR` is set to
`TV Shows` and `/output` is mapped to `$HOME/appvolumes/HandBrake` on the host,
`$HOME/appvolumes/HandBrake/TV Shows` should be monitored by the application.
application.

## Intel Quick Sync Video

Intel Quick Sync Video is Intel's brand for its dedicated video encoding and
decoding hardware core.  It is a technology that is capable of offloading video
decoding and encoding task to the integrated GPU, thus saving the CPU usage to
do other tasks.  As a specialized hardware core on the processor die, Quick Sync
offers a much more power efficient video processing which is much superior to
video encoding on a CPU.

For HandBrake to be able to use hardware-accelerated encoding, the following are
required:

  - Have a compatible Intel processor.  To determine if your CPU has the Quick
    Sync Video hardware, consult this [list] from the [Intel Ark] website.  The
    model name of your processor is printed to the container's log during its
    startup.  Look for a message like this:
    ```
    [cont-init.d] 95-check-qsv.sh: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz
    ```
  - The Intel i915 graphic driver must be loaded on the **host**.
  - The `/dev/dri` device must be exposed to the container.  This is done by
    adding the `--device /dev/dri` parameter to the `docker run` command.

When Intel Quick Sync Video is properly enabled, HandBrake offers the following
video encoder:
```
H.264 (Intel QSV)
```

If this encoder is not part of the list, something is wrong and looking at the
container's log can give more details about the issue.

### unRAID

The Intel i915 driver is already included in unRAID.  To automatically load the
driver during the startup of the host, the following lines must be added to
`/boot/config/go`:
```
# Load the i915 driver.
modprobe i915
```

## Nightly Builds

HandBrake nightly builds are based on the latest development code, which means
they may or may not be stable.

The latest development version is available by using the `dev-latest` Docker
image tag.  For other specific development versions, look at available
[tags on Docker Hub].

When creating the container, the tag needs to be appended to the name of the
Docker image, like this:
```
docker run [OPTIONS..] jlesage/handbrake:dev-latest
```

## Debug Builds

Debug builds can be used to better investigate problems that can occur with
HandBrake.  These builds have HandBrake
compiled in debug mode and all symbols are kept.

The main use case of debug builds is debugging a crash.  To do this, a core dump
needs to be generated when HandBrake crashes.  To make sure
this core dump is properly generated, two things are required:

  1. Core dumps must be enabled.  This is done by setting the maximum size of
     cores via the `--ulimit core=-1` parameter of the `docker run` command.
     A value of `-1` mean "unlimited".
  2. Location of the cores must be set.  This can be done by executing the
     following command on the **host**:
     ```
     echo 'CORE_PATTERN' | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
     ```
     Where `CORE_PATTERN` is the template that defines the naming of core dump
     files.  For example, to set the files in the configuration volume of the
     container (for easy retrieval from the host), use the pattern
     `/config/core.%e.%t`.

     **NOTE**: Because a core file contains the complete memory layout of an
     application, it is created with restrictive permissions.  If another user
     other than the one used to run HandBrake needs to access
     the core file, permissions must be changed by executing
     `chmod a+r CORE`, where `CORE` is the path to the core file.

     **NOTE**: Since the core dump files pattern is shared between the host and
     the container, you may want to revert to the original pattern once
     done.

     **NOTE**: The current value of the pattern can be obtained by executing
     `cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`.

Debug builds are available by using Docker image tags with the `debug` suffix.
Make sure to look at available [tags on Docker Hub].

When creating the container, the tag needs to be appended to the name of the
Docker image, like this:
```
docker run [OPTIONS..] jlesage/handbrake:v1.14.3-debug
```

[tags on Docker Hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/jlesage/handbrake/tags/

### unRAID

On systems running unRAID, the `--ulimit core=-1` parameter can be added to the
`Extra Parameters` field of the container settings.
