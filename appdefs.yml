    sections:
      - title: Access to Optical Drive(s)
        level: 2
        content: |-
          By default, a Docker container doesn't have access to host's devices.  However,
          access to one or more device can be granted with the `--device DEV` parameter.

          Optical drives usually have `/dev/srX` as device.  For example, the first drive
          is `/dev/sr0`, the second `/dev/sr1`, and so on.  To allow HandBrake to access
          the first drive, this parameter is needed:
          ```
          --device /dev/sr0
          ```

          To easily find devices of optical drives, start the container and look at its
          log for messages similar to these ones:
          ```
          ...
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: executing...
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: looking for usable optical drives...
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: found optical drive /dev/sr0, but it is not usable because is not exposed to the container.
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: no usable optical drive found.
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: exited 0.
          ...
          ```

          Since HandBrake can decrypt DVD video discs, their conversion can be performed
          directly from the optical device.  From the graphical interface, click the
          `Open Source` button and browse through the file system to find your optical
          drive device (e.g. `/dev/sr0`).
      - title: Automatic Video Conversion
        level: 2
        content: |-
          This container has an automatic video converter built-in.  This is useful to
          batch-convert videos without user interaction.

          Basically, files copied to the `/watch` container folder are automatically
          converted by HandBrake to a pre-defined video format according to a pre-defined
          preset.

          All configuration parameters of the automatic video converter are
          defined via environment variables.  See the
          [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for the list of
          available variables.  The ones having their name starting with
          `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_` apply to the automatic video converter.

          **NOTE**: A preset is identified by its category and its name.

          **NOTE**: All default presets, along with personalized/custom ones, can be seen
          and edited with the HandBrake GUI.

          **NOTE**: Converted videos are stored, by default, to the `/output` folder of
          the container.

          **NOTE**: The status and progression of conversions performed by the automatic
          video converter can be seen from both the GUI and the container's log.
          Container's log can be obtained by executing the command
          `docker logs handbrake`, where `handbrake` is the name of the container.  Also,
          full details about the conversion are stored in `/config/log/hb/conversion.log`
          (container path).
      - title: Multiple Watch Folders
        level: 3
        content: |-
          If needed, additionnal watch folders can be used:
            - `/watch2`
            - `/watch3`
            - `/watch4`
            - `/watch5`
            - etc.

          This is useful for scenarios where videos need to be converted by different
          presets.  For example, one could use a watch folder for movies and another watch
          folder for TV shows, both having different encoding quality requirements.

          By default, additional watch folders inherits the same settings has the main one
          (`/watch`).  A setting for a particular watch folder can be overriden by adding
          its index to the corresponding environment variable name.

          For example, to set the HandBrake preset used to convert videos in `/watch2`,
          the environment variable `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_PRESET_2` is used.
          `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_PRESET_3` is used for `/watch3`, and so on.

          All settings related to the automatic video converter (environment variables
          with name prefixed with `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_`) can be overriden for each
          additional watch folder.

          The maximum number of watch folders handled by the automatic video converter
          is defined by the `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_MAX_WATCH_FOLDERS` environment variable.

          **NOTE**: Each additional watch folder must be mapped to a folder on the host by
          adding a volume mapping during the creation of the container.

          **NOTE**: Each output folder defined via the `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_DIR`
          environment variable must be mapped to a folder on the host by adding a volume
          mapping during the creation of the container.
      - title: Video Discs
        level: 3
        content: |-
          The automatic video converter supports video discs, in the following format:
            - ISO image file.
            - DVD video disc folder containing the `VIDEO_TS` folder.
            - Blu-ray video disc folder containing the `BDMV` folder.

          Note that folder names are case sensitive.  For example, `video_ts`, `Video_Ts`
          or `Bdmv` won't be treated as discs, but as normal directories.

          When the source is a disc folder, the name of the converted video file will
          match to one of its folder.  For example, `/watch/MyMovie/VIDEO_TS` will produce
          a video file with name `MyMovie.mp4`.

          Video discs can have multiple titles (the main movie, previews, extras, etc).
          In a such case, each title is converted to its own file.  These files have the
          suffix `.title-XX`, where `XX` is the title number. For example, if the file
          `MyMovie.iso` has 2 titles, the following files would be generated:
            - `MyMovie.title-1.mp4`
            - `MyMovie.title-2.mp4`

          It is possible to ignore titles shorted than a specific amount of time.  By
          default, only titles longer than 10 seconds are processed.  This duration can be
          adjusted via the `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_SOURCE_MIN_DURATION` environment
          variable.  See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for
          details about setting environment variables.
      - title: Hooks
        level: 3
        content: |-
          Custom actions can be performed using hooks.  Hooks are shell scripts executed
          by the automatic video converter.

          **NOTE**: Hooks are always invoked via `/bin/sh`, ignoring any shebang the
          script may have.

          Hooks are optional and by default, no one is defined.  A hook is defined and
          executed when the script is found at a specific location.

          The following table describe available hooks:

          | Container location | Description | Parameter(s) |
          |--------------------|-------------|--------------|
          | `/config/hooks/pre_conversion.sh` | Hook executed before the beginning of a video conversion. | The first argument is the path of the converted video.  The second argument is the path to the source file.  Finally, the third argument is the name of the Handbrake preset that will be used to convert the video. |
          | `/config/hooks/post_conversion.sh` | Hook executed when the conversion of a video file is terminated. | The first parameter is the status of the conversion.  A value of `0` indicates that the conversion terminated successfuly.  Any other value represent a failure.  The second argument is the path to the converted video (the output).  The third argument is the path to the source file.  Finally, the fourth argument is the name of the Handbrake preset used to convert the video. |
          | `/config/hooks/post_watch_folder_processing.sh` | Hook executed after all videos in the watch folder have been processed. | The path of the watch folder. |

          During the first start of the container, example hooks are installed in
          `/config/hooks/`.  Example scripts have the suffix `.example`.  For example,
          you can use `/config/hooks/post_conversion.sh.example` as a starting point.

          **NOTE**: Keep in mind that this container has the minimal set of packages
          required to run HandBrake.  This may limit actions that can be performed in
          hooks.
      - title: Temporary Conversion Directory
        level: 3
        content: |-
          A video being converted is written in a hidden, temporary directory under the
          root of the output directory (`/output` by default).  Once a conversion
          successfully terminates, the video file is moved to its final location.

          This feature can be useful for scenarios where the output folder is monitored
          by another application: with proper configuration, one can make sure this
          application only "sees" the final, converted video file and not the transient
          versions.

          If the monitoring application ignores hidden directories, then nothing special
          is required and the application should always see the final file.

          However, if the monitoring application handles hidden directories, the automatic
          video converter should be configured with the
          `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_SUBDIR` environment variable sets to a
          subdirectory.  The application can then be configured to monitor this
          subdirectory.  For example, if `AUTOMATED_CONVERSION_OUTPUT_SUBDIR` is set to
          `TV Shows` and `/output` is mapped to `/home/user/appvolumes/HandBrake` on the
          host, `/home/user/appvolumes/HandBrake/TV Shows` should be monitored by the
          application.
      - title: Intel Quick Sync Video
        level: 2
        content: |-
          Intel Quick Sync Video is Intel's brand for its dedicated video encoding and
          decoding hardware core.  It is a technology that is capable of offloading video
          decoding and encoding task to the integrated GPU, thus saving the CPU usage to
          do other tasks.  As a specialized hardware core on the processor die, Quick Sync
          offers a much more power efficient video processing which is much superior to
          video encoding on a CPU.

          For HandBrake to be able to use hardware-accelerated encoding, the following are
          required:

            - Have a compatible Intel processor.  To determine if your CPU has the Quick
              Sync Video hardware, consult this [list] from the [Intel Ark] website.  The
              model name of your processor is printed to the container's log during its
              startup.  Look for a message like this:
              ```
              [cont-init.d] 95-check-qsv.sh: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz
              ```
            - The Intel i915 graphic driver must be loaded on the **host**.
            - The `/dev/dri` device must be exposed to the container.  This is done by
              adding the `--device /dev/dri` parameter to the `docker run` command.

          When Intel Quick Sync Video is properly enabled, HandBrake offers the following
          video encoder:
          ```
          H.264 (Intel QSV)
          ```

          If this encoder is not part of the list, something is wrong and looking at the
          container's log can give more details about the issue.

          **NOTE**: In most cases, HandBrake can successfully access the `/dev/dri` device
          without changing anything on the host side.  This is possible because the user
          under which the container is running is automatically added to the group owning
          the `/dev/dri` device.  However, this method doesn't work if the device is owned
          by the group `root`.  The problem can be fixed using one of the following
          methods:
            - Running the container as root (`USER_ID=0`).
            - Adding, on the host, read/write permissions for all to the `/dev/dri`
              device:
              ```
              sudo chmod a+wr /dev/dri/*
              ```
            - Changing, on the host, the group owning the `/dev/dri` device.  For example,
              to change the group to `video`:
              ```
              sudo chown root:video /dev/dri/*
              ```

        content: |-
          With recent versions of unRAID, the Intel i915 driver is already included in the
          distribution and is automatically loaded.
          
          With older versions, the following lines might need to be added to
          `/boot/config/go` for the driver to be loaded during the startup of unRAID:
          ```
          # Load the i915 driver.
          modprobe i915
          ```
      - title: Nightly Builds
        level: 2
        content: |-
          Nightly builds are based on the latest {{ app.friendly_name }} development code.
          This means that they may have bugs, crashes and instabilities.

          Nightly builds are available through Docker image tags.  These tags have the
          following format:
          ```
          nightly-<COMMIT_DATE>-<COMMIT_HASH>
          ```

          Where:
            - `COMMIT_DATE` is the date (in `YYMMDDHHMMSS` format) of the latest commit
              from the {{ app.friendly_name }} [Git repository].
            - `COMMIT_HASH` is the short hash of the latest commit from the {{ app.friendly_name }}
              [Git repository].

          The latest nightly build is available through the `nightly-latest` Docker image
          tag.  The list of available tags are available on [Docker Hub].

          To use a Docker image tag, it has to be appended to the name of the Docker image
          during the creation of the container.  Here is an example:
          ```
          docker run [OPTIONS..] jlesage/{{ app.name }}:nightly-latest
          ```

          [Git repository]: https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake
          [Docker Hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/jlesage/{{ app.name }}/tags/
      - title: Debug Builds
        level: 2
        content: |-
          Debug builds can be used to better investigate problems that can occur with
          {{ app.friendly_name }}.  These builds have {{ app.friendly_name }}
          compiled in debug mode and all symbols are kept.

          The main use case of debug builds is debugging a crash.  To do this, a core dump
          needs to be generated when {{ app.friendly_name }} crashes.  To make sure
          this core dump is properly generated, two things are required:

            1. Core dumps must be enabled.  This is done by setting the maximum size of
               cores via the `--ulimit core=-1` parameter of the `docker run` command.
               A value of `-1` mean "unlimited".
            2. Location of the cores must be set.  This can be done by executing the
               following command on the **host**:
               ```
               echo 'CORE_PATTERN' | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
               ```
               Where `CORE_PATTERN` is the template that defines the naming of core dump
               files.  For example, to set the files in the configuration volume of the
               container (for easy retrieval from the host), use the pattern
               `/config/core.%e.%t`.

               **NOTE**: Because a core file contains the complete memory layout of an
               application, it is created with restrictive permissions.  If another user
               other than the one used to run {{ app.friendly_name }} needs to access
               the core file, permissions must be changed by executing
               `chmod a+r CORE`, where `CORE` is the path to the core file.

               **NOTE**: Since the core dump files pattern is shared between the host and
               the container, you may want to revert to the original pattern once
               done.

               **NOTE**: The current value of the pattern can be obtained by executing
               `cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`.

          Debug builds are available by using Docker image tags with the `debug` suffix.
          Make sure to look at available [tags on Docker Hub].

          When creating the container, the tag needs to be appended to the name of the
          Docker image, like this:
          ```
          docker run [OPTIONS..] jlesage/{{ app.name }}:v1.14.3-debug
          ```

        When set to `1`, the automatic video converter uses the trash directory.
        So when the automatic video converter is configured to *not* keep
        sources, it will move them to the trash directory (`/trash` inside the
        container) instead of deleting them.
